# 1. Write a Python program to read each row from a given csv file and print a list of strings.

# import csv
# with open('departments.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
#     data = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|')
#     for row in data:
#         print(''.join(row))

# 2. Write a Python program to read a given CSV file having tab delimiter.

import csv

with open('countries.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    data = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter='\t')
    for row in data:
        print(''.join(row))
